                        <h1> VIA Journey </h1>
                        <p> As Canada’s only provider of coast-to-coast passenger rail service, VIA Rail is Canada’s equivalent of a national passenger train. VIA Rail’s primary revenue stream comes from its local commuter services, with its highly rated long-distance tourism trains struggling in sales. </p>
                        <p> VIA Journey is our digital solution to VIA Rail’s declining ridership and brand misperception, inviting first-time potential passengers to reassess the value proposition VIA Rail offers. As a microsite VIA Journey presents train travel as an alternative and enjoyable form of transportation tourism, aligning VIA Rail’s value proposition alongside consumers’ tangible, intangible, and aspirational values.</p>

                            <p>In the last two years, the Canadian transportation tourism industry has seen a surge in demand as an increasing number of Canadians choose to vacation domestically. This growth in demand has been observed across the entire industry, with passenger air and train rivals such as Rocky Mountaineer observing double-digit growth. </p>
                            <p>Despite this, VIA Rail is struggling to fill seats and has seen its tourism trains losing $8 million in 2016 alone. While demand for transportation tourism evidently exists, little of it was directed towards VIA Rail's offerings. The poor performance of VIA Rail relative to its competitors was our first indication that VIA Rail had a problem with its value proposition.</p>

                    <h3> Testing Initial Assumptions: User Research</h3>
                    <p> After completing our first phase of research, we concluded that VIA Rail was seen as an unappealing option for tourism due to train travel's higher upfront costs, unpredictable schedules with extended delays, and the smaller living and leisure spaces. This assumption led our initial attempts in ideating solutions, exploring solutions &amp; improvements to the onboard experience. However, I decided to leverage VIA Rail's recent Canada 150 campaign and brought in a number of friends and peers who had experienced VIA Rail firsthand, travelling across Canada over the summer. What we learned right away was that none of the aforementioned issues mattered to our respondents - they all found the onboard experience excellent.

                    <p> As VIA Rail's current website was ineffective at enticing potential passengers onboard to discover their excellent tourism experience, we proposed a digital solution that invites travellers to view Canada with a different perspective. Our product, VIA Journey guides visitors through a digital journey that reflects the physical adventure VIA Rail offers, emphasizing the value offered by a relaxed pace of travel - connecting passengers with an carefully crafted tourism transportation <strong>where the journey is as valuable as the destination.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p> To guide our design process, our team leveraged three core design principles as the structure of our designer's framework. Having a holistic structure allowed us to freely ideate and explore the creative space, while ensuring we remained aware of both the project objective and remained focused at the task at hand. More importantly, beginning from a valid business justification required us to constantly evaluate the worth of our design proposal - was what we were creating a useful addition to the brand?</p>

In our user interviews, we found that most passengers had no trouble at all with the onboard experience.

                            <p>With VIA Rail's Destination 2025, VIA Rail identified four key brand values intended to guide their organizational and product strategy for the next decade. We chose to leverage Connectivity as an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between passengers, employees and assets; by interpreting assets as the exclusive access train travel provides to remote landscapes, as well as the associated stops, activities, scenery and onboard amenities. This intent manifested in our content through the idea that when travelling with VIA Rail, the journey is as valuable as the destination.</p>

                            <p>However, we recognized that brand values can be too abstract for consumers to care - to bridge that gap we had to translate Connectivity into something valuable for potential passengers. The team broke down the brand value of Connectivity, and studied its relationship with actual tangible, intangible, and aspirational offerings. </p>

                            <p>Combining our earlier user research alongside our brand study, we created a brand perceptual map that reflected VIA Rail's positioning relative to its competitors in the transportation tourism industry. What we observed was that despite VIA Rail's real competition being other long-haul tourism providers, many of our respondents actually compared their offerings to short-term providers such as airlines. With consumers unwilling to pay the price premium over airlines for VIA Rail, this misperception poses a significant risk to VIA Rail's business. Our research revealed two main false assumptions behind this:

With that perspective, train travel's higher price is much more reasonable when considering that it offers a packaged solution of a hotel, dining, and a natural scenery tourism travel experience.</p>

                            <p> With our research and design intention in mind, we decided on a plan of execution. Rather than develop a brand new product for VIA Rail, we applied the Ansoff Growth Matrix to determine that it was a better investment of taxpayer dollars to strengthen the connection of VIA Rail's existing assets. We focused on first-time potential customers as our focus, choosing this audience due to the lack of pre-existing biases towards the brand. More importantly, focusing on new customer group wouldn't isolate the other customer segments. </p>

                            <p> Our persona of the open-minded adventurer represented this customer segment, and was created from both our user interviews, as well as online reviewers and travel bloggers. This persona resonated well with our concept of having the journey be as valuable as the destination, with this persona being open-minded to new experiences and wanting to maximize their travel. </p>

                    <p>We found the most appropriate medium for our solution was on web, as VIA Rail relied primarily on digital sales for tickets. By taking our persona through their existing user journey framework from initial online research to actually travelling on VIA Rail, we found that the reason why potential passengers were getting "stuck" in the early discovery stage was due to a gap in the value proposition. </p>

                    <p>The existing website's painpoints around information being hidden in download-only PDFs, lack of distinction from commuter rail, and difficult to digest information meant that consumers struggled to make it past the initial exploration of the site. Even when they did, the difficulty to reach information created high cognitive overhead and caused potential passengers to worry about basic needs such as food and space - like how one of our respondents felt during our user interviews. </p>
                    <p>This prompted us to narrow into this initial Entice stage even further, and we leveraged Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to structure how information could be delivered through this discovery stage. </p>
                    <img src=" img/via/maslows.jpg " class="gallery-items">
                    <p>We recognized that when basic needs are met, people are motivated to achieve higher level goals. Our second insight was to organize our value proposition so to present tangible, intangible, and aspirational values in alignment with Maslow's as they progress through the entice phase. While Maslow's cannot be mapped 1-to-1 with the user journey, we hoped to create a user flow that would guide users to higher level goals by first addressing basic needs. </p>

                    <p>In order to implement our design &amp; business strategy, we needed to visually communicate the idea that the journey is as valuable as the destination.

                    <p>By leveraging a train window as our design metaphor, we could entice potential passengers by highlighting the offerings VIA Rail could provide through travelling across Canada. This would manifest in our design work as full-bleed imagery with sequential views as we guided users through our digital experience, scrolling through select panels that would provide digestible chunks of information meant to appeal to each level of needs and values. This showed up early in our exploratory sketches, and influencing our initial mock-ups. </p>

                    <h3> Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>VIA Journey represented my first user experience project, and was where I was introduced to Sprints and the jungle of mental models present in Newbery &amp; Farnham's Experience Design book. The greatest surprise to me was how heavily involved business thinking and strategy was at the core of this project. I found myself comfortably explaining business decisions to my team members, switching back and forth between design and business contexts. </p>

                    <h3> Impact</h3>
                    <p>We believe that VIA Journey better entices potential passengers to consider VIA Rail as a viable option for transportation tourism, through addressing painpoints on the original site as well as realigning VIA Rail's perceived value proposition with their intended one. Looking forward, I'd want to address accessibility concerns as well as rethinking how VIA Journey would appear on different devices. </p>
                    <p>VIA Journey went on to being selected by Chelsea Garber from Inamoto &amp; Co. as one of the two winning projects of the term, with our team being selected for an opportunity to be mentored by Chelsea on a brief from Inamoto' &amp; Co's client Toyota.</p>
