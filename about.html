                    <h1> It's Me!</h1>
                    <p> Born in Hukou, Taiwan and raised in Vancouver, I'm fascinated by the thinking behind <strong> everything.</strong> </p>
                    <p>I'm also never happy with just one-side of the story, leading me to further my education in business after my second-year in design at Simon Fraser University. Turns out I quite enjoy the business strategy behind design, and briefly pursued a career in digital marketing before coming back to what I love best: being at the intersection of design &amp; business, creating experiences that contributes to both customers &amp; businesses.
                    </p>
                    <p> Talk to me about consumer technology (I'm basically the Buyers' Guide for friends &amp; family), badminton, 20th Century European History, or British quiz shows :) </p>
